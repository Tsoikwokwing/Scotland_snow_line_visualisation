# Scotland_snow_line_visualisation

1. Put the ipynb file and the unzipped DataForvisualisation in the same directory and run jupyter notebook in the virtual environment. 

2. I have already saved all the outputs in the ipynb file. If some outputs are disappered, you can click 'Kernel'-->'Restart & Run All' to get all the outputs again.
